# SummArtic
Scraping a desired article and summarising them with NLP into a much shorter read.
It is still in development, and at the moment it only works with BBC articles. In the future I'd like to extend its capabilites to most articles found on the web.
Just change the link to the link of the article you would like to summerise and dont forget to install the dependencies. 
After that, just run it.
